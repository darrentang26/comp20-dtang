1. The purpose of this repository was to store all the assignments of this class
2. My favorite assignment was assignment 2, it was the first assignment to really show how programs 
   really work together and first look at APIs, how reinventing the wheel is unnecessary
3. Since day 1 I feel like I have grown up a lot, as a programmer and person. Learning so many
   different languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript introduced me to several different types
   of programming styles and concepts, each tailored to different, specific services. The final
   project was one of my first indepenedent group project experiences, many lessons learned
   from the experience.
4. One of the most important things learned in this class was the learning of APIs. For example, building
   a geolocation/map service from the ground up is unnecessary as the Google Maps API works well for 
   most purposes of this sort and is easily accessible for the most part. For basic operations, there
   is most likely an API that has already been developed, something that has been revealed through 
   research for the final project.
5. After finishing this course, the aspect I am most interested in is the storage of big data in 
   databases and the many ways in which the data is stored, sorted, queried, and so on.
