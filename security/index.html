	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>Product: Rideshare service that stores data of passengers and drivers in order for passengers<br>
	   and drivers to find each other.<br>
	   Job description: Finding security and privacy vulnerabilities the rideshare service, with the<br>
	   website itself and the database the website stores all the information</p>
	<h1>Methodology</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Black Box Testing:</li>
		<li>Use of MongoDB commands to manipulate the database to display classified information</li>
		<li>Injecting JavaScript code into database using cURL to HTTP POST</li>
		<li>Third-Party tools such as BurpSuite and OWASP's Zed Attack Proxy (refer to references)</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Abstraction of Findings</h1>
		<p>Using built in commands, all the passenger data in the database is accessible<br>
		   Trying to input script code that would cause the website/program to behave differently<br>
		   than intended proves that the database server has some sort of serverside validation, or<br>
		   ways to change the input so it no longer looks like code, and will be read as not code.
		</p>
	<h1>Issues Found</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Database Leak</li>
		<ul>
			<li>All passenger can be obtained using MongoDB command loopholes</li>
			<li>Location: /passenger.json route</li>
			<li>Severity: High</li>
			<li>Every passenger's information is accessible by anyone, could be sensitive data</li>
			<li><img src="screenshots/Database_leak.PNG" alt="Screenshot of database leak" id="dbleak"/></li>
			<li>Resolution: Rather than sending the input to search the database directly,<br>
			                take a query that's put in a separate string and parse out unnecessary<br>
			                characters, send that string to the database to search</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
	<h1>Conclusion</h1>
		<p>Overall the program is well protected from XSS and other injection<br>
		   based attacks due to good use of validation from all aspects of input
